# Katzenpost free software project

## Introduction

Katzenpost is an anonymous communication network, a decryption mix network
and is the first post quantum mix network. Katzenpost is actively being
developed and we hope to soon improve our documentation and our website.

It is our mission to research and development useful mixnet protocols
to help people communicate more freely.

Our project goals are closely aligned with the cypherpunk's manifesto:
